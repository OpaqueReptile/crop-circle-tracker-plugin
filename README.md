# Crop Circle Tracker Plugin

A RuneLite plugin for crowdsourcing crop circle tracking. Nearby crop circles are detected and reported to a
backend server ([default server](https://github.com/mattjrumble/crop-circle-tracker-server)). The server combines
sightings to calculate the location of crop circles in different worlds. The plugin gets these locations from the
server and displays them in a panel so users can quick-hop to a world where a crop circle is present. Mainly useful
for area-locked/snowflake accounts.
